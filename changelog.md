I added a new section of skill bars representing my proficiency in different languages in the Experience page (formerly called projects page). This section consists of a new header, description, as well as bar graphs of various languages. I also added more to my contacts page: I added a statement of interest and also included a link to my linkedin. I also added the script for Google Analytics that allows for user tracking to my site. It is under the <head> tag in each of my HTML pages. I added this because I thought it would be most useful. After all, since the purpose of my website is to showcase my projects to recruiters for them to contact me about job opportunities, I am very interested in number of users come across my site.
